  *Hi,</br>
Thank you for contacting vercel support.I am Naveen and will be assisting you on your case.FRom the case i can understand that we need to understand how to perform the redirection from "/hello-vercel" to "https://vercel.com".Please correct me if i am wrong.</br>
To achieve the same allow me to share the steps to configure the same.</br>
Please see below.</br>
  
 <ul>
   <li>Login to your vercel account</li></br>
<li>Click on the project in which we want to configure the redirection</li></br>
<li>Click on the Settings(Project Settings) from the top.</li></br>
<li> We should see on the left hand side section called domains,click on it.</li></br>
<li> Type the domain in the domain search and click on Add button.</li></br>
<li>Once we have added the needed domain(vercel.com) we need to add the TXT record for the domain in the DNS record</li></br>
<li>Once the record is verified we should see the redirection working which would be based on if its permanent redirection or temporary redirection</li></br>
<li>Finally we can verify by accessing the url and see if its redirecting to the "https://vercel.com"</li></br>
</ul>

</br>
Hi,</br>
</br>
Thank you for contacting vercel support.I am Naveen and will be assisting you on your case.From the case i can understand that we need to understand how to perform the redirection from "/hello-vercel" to "https://vercel.com".Please correct me if i am wrong.</br>
To achieve the same allow me to share the steps to configure the same.</br>
</br>

 <ul>
<li>Login to your vercel account</li></br>
<li>Click on the project in which we want to configure the redirection</li></br>
<li>Click on the Settings(Project Settings) from the top.</li></br>
<li> We should see on the left hand side section called domains,click on it.</li></br>
<li> Type the domain in the domain search and click on Add button.</li></br>
<li>Once we have added the needed domain(vercel.com) we need to add the TXT record for the domain in the DNS record</li></br>
<li>Once the record is verified we should see the redirection working which would be based on if its permanent redirection or temporary redirection</li></br>
<li>Finally we can verify by accessing the url and see if its redirecting to the "https://vercel.com"</li></br>
</ul>
</br>
</br>

<li><b>A customer writes in to the Helpdesk stating "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project". In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?</b></li>
</br>
Hi </br>
Thank you for contacting vercel support.I am Naveen and will be assisting you on your case.From the case i can understand that we need to understand how to use the custom domain purchased within your project.Please correct me if i am wrong.</br>
We can use the custom doamin for redirection and to achieve the same allow me to share the steps to configure the same.</br>
Please see below.</br>

 <ul>
<li>Login to your vercel account</li></br>
<li>Click on the project in which we want to configure the redirection</li></br>
<li>Click on the Settings(Project Settings) from the top.</li></br>
<li> We should see on the left hand side section called domains,click on it.</li></br>
<li> Type the domain in the domain search and click on Add button.</li></br>
<li>Once we have added the needed domain(vercel.com) we need to add the TXT record for the domain in the DNS record</li></br>
<li>Once the record is verified we should see the redirection working which would be based on if its permanent redirection or temporary redirection</li></br>
<li>Finally we can verify by accessing the url and see if its redirecting to the required URL</li></br>
</ul>
</br>
</br>

<li><b>What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?</b></li>
</br>
 * I believe customer would be asking more on the redirection of the URL if customer has thier own custom domain.</br>
To overcome common problems I would be creating technical articles which would be available to customers  publicly so that they can directly refere the steps and overcome the challenges.</br>
Also woulbe be checking if the same can be automated to overcome the same by running the script.</br>
</br>
</br>
<li><b> How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?</b></li>
* We can definately think of creating technical articles to help customers refer the same repeated issues.</br>
* creating some videos of the same which can be referred for the repeated issues.</br>
* If it can be automated will be creating script.</br>
